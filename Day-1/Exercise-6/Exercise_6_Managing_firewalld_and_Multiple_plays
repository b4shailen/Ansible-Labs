		############################################################

# Task 1 - Create new project directory named "Multiple_Plays" in your home directory

# Task 2 - Create new ansible configuration such as done in previous exercise. You can also copy to save time.

# Task 3 - Create inventory file as follows :
	a) webserver group contains host1.example.com
	b) dbserver group contains host2.example.com

# Task 4 - Create playbook named "Multiple_plays.yml" :
	a) Ensure latest version of httpd and firewalld packages is installed on hosts grouped under webserver.
	b) Ensure firewalld and httpd services is enabled and started
	c) Make sure firewalld allow http connections.
	d) Make sure the file /var/www/html/index.html in managed hosts contains "Welcome, Ansible is awesome."

# Task 5 - Extend the Multiple_plays.yml to add following things :
	a) Ensure latest version of mariadb-server and firewalld packages is installed on hosts under dbserver.
	b) Ensure firewalld and mysql services are enabled and started.
	c) Make sure firewalld allows connection to mariadb service.

# Task 6 - Extend your playbook to "Verify your webserver" :
	a) This just requires verifying webserver which can be done using URI module and checking status code 200.
	b) This task should not require privilege escalation.
