		## Practice Ad-Hoc Commands ##
		##############################

# Task 1 - Create a user with following requirements :
	a) User named "devuser" with uid=3001 and with /sbin/nologin shell assigned to it on dev hosts
	b) Web hosts should have a user named "webuser" with uid=2002 and with comments as "This is a web user"

# Task 2 - Know the difference between command and shell module:
	a) Get the hostname of all managed hosts by running hostname command using command module.
	b) Run some shell built-in command like 'set' on all managed hosts using command module.
	c) If (b) doesn't work, try with shell module.

# Task 3 - Using copy module in Ad-Hoc Commands:
 	a) Write the following contents in /etc/motd file on all managed hosts.
		"This host is managed by Ansible. Any changes will be discarded.\n"


## Conclusion, The difference between two should be clear. ##
